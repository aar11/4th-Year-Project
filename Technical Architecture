Software Components

Databases & Application Engines:
It is undecided which of the below cloud platforms will be used for this application.

Azure
The functionality that Azure provides that will be used is the database.

AWS
The functionality that AWS provides that will be used is the database.

Mobile Platforms:
The application will be for an android mobile platform. Android SDK will be used as it 
provides the API libraries and developer tools that are necessary to build, test and debug 
applications for Android.

Platform Libraries:

Twitter REST API
Twitter REST API will be used for the access to read and write Twitter data.

Android API
The application can be used up to the Android 4.4 (KitKat) API as this is the most up to date 
API available for android at the moment.

Java
The application will be written in Java as this is the main developing application language for 
android.

XML: 
XML will be used to separate structure from logic. XML is a proven standard that provides a 
format that is durable for the storage of information and the transmission of that 
information. It makes code scalable and maintainable.

D3 JavaScript Library:
D3 JavaScript library is a library which can be used for the reporting functionality of the 
application. D3 allows for data to be powerfully visualised.

Distribution and Deployment
In relation to distribution and deployment the aim is to deploy this application on to the 
Android market.

Risks
 Voice Recognition: The voice recognition functionality is the main functionality of the 
application as it allows the user to use the application without breaking the law. It is 
illegal in Ireland to use your phone while driving so voice recognition is the only way 
around breaking that law. The risk that voice recognition poses to the delivery of my 
project is that if it doesn’t work efficiently then the application will not work. 
 GPS Location: It is crucial to the project that the GPS location is accurate. If the GPS 
location was incorrect then it would pose a huge threat to the project as users of the 
application would be reading incorrect information.
 Application – Twitter: One of the main functionalities of the project is that the 
information is posted on to a Twitter page. If the information fails to be posted on a 
twitter page then this would be a huge threat to the project. Prototypes

Week 8 Prototype
The use cases that will be delivered by week 8 are:

Use Case 1:
Title: Reporting Traffic
Primary Actor: User
Scope: The application 
Level: User reports traffic
Story: 4. User reports traffic using voice recognition.
5. The GPS location of the phone is taken.
6. The GPS location is used to post the information to a twitter page.

Use Case 2:
Title: Reporting an Accident
Primary Actor: User
Scope: The application 
Level: User reports an accident
Story: 4. User reports an accident using voice recognition.
5. The GPS location of the phone is taken.
6. The GPS location is used to post the information to a twitter page.

Testing Strategy:
The functionality in the above use cases will be tested by black-box testing. Test cases will 
be done up for the below:
 To test the voice recognition. Valid test cases and invalid test cases will be selected 
to ensure that the voice recognition works when certain commands are said. For 
example, if the user says “I see traffic” then the voice recognition should pick up that 
command. If the user says “Good morning” then the voice recognition shouldn’t pick 
that sentence up.
 To test the accuracy of the GPS location. When the user says the “I see traffic” 
command then the GPS location will be taken. Test cases will be created to test that 
the location is correct.
 To test that the information is been posted to a Twitter page. Test cases will be 
developed to test that the traffic and accident information is posted to a Twitter 
page.
